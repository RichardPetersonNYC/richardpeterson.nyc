                <p class="white-color ft-300">I am going to go out on a limb and say that Belgrade resembles NYC in so many ways.<br />
                Clearly being bias as so many great memories and life changing experiences for me happened right there. I got signed to my first modeling agency while living in Belgrade, got an opportunity to play volleyball on a professional level and overall life started changing for better once I moved to the capital from my hometown. There is something peculiar about its nightlife, the overall cosmopolitan vibe about people and general approach to life, partying, and living in the moment. Considering all of the above and the fact that most of my family and friends still call Belgrade home I will always be coming back with excitement and vigor.</p>
