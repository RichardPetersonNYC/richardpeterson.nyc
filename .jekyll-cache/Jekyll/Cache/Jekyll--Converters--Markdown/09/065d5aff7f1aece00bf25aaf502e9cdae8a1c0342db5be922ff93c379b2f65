                <p class="white-color ft-300">I have to admit Miami stayed true to the way it is so commonly depicted in pop culture. One of the most vibrant cities that conforms its day to day existence to the celebrated reputation of a night life party central. It is only natural that it is called home by some of the most popular celebrities. During my stay I just had to visit the famous Versace mansion considering what an epic status it has. Another must see spot is definitely Key West. It is beyond picturesque and offers miles of charming streets with a unique architecture that at sunset offers unbeatable views. Head over to Miami if you are young, or feeling young or just want to be reminded of how it feels to be uninhibited and free</p>
