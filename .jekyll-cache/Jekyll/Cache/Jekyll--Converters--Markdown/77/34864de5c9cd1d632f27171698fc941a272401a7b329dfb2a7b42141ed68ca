                <p>Natural materials, traditional fine bag making craftsmanship, creative design. And passion for our products and the colourful life they accompany us through – that is what makes <a class="red ft-400" href="https://instagram.com/picard_official?utm_source=ig_profile_share&amp;igshid=xd47wo7h4qau/" target="_blank">PICARD</a> so unique. And has done since 1928.<br />
                Since then, we as a family firm have passed the enthusiasm for beautiful leather goods down from generation to generation. The same goes for the experience and knowledge required for the high-quality processing of leather. In this way PICARD is one of the few training companies that still consistently pass on fine bag craftsmanship.<br />
                That makes PICARD a brand you can touch. Conscientious, personal, emotional, warm-hearted, lively, curious, fun-loving. As individual as the people who carry PICARD. Let’s call it simply “my favourite brand with tradition”. I love PICARD.</p>
