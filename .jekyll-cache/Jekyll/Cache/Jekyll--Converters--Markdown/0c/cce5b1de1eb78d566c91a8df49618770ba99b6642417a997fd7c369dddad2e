                <p>This is a premium brand and theyâ€™re certainly not cheap. But as a guy whoâ€™s tested underwear from both ends of the quality spectrum (and everywhere in between) <a class="red ft-400" href="https://instagram.com/taniunderwear?utm_source=ig_profile_share&amp;igshid=1tpof2890ikav/" target="_blank">Tani USA</a> certainly knows whatâ€™s up in the comfort department.<br />
                Based in Brooklyn, NY, Tani USA describes itself as the worldâ€™s best and most comfortable unisex underwear.<br />
                The brand was founded in 2013 â€” and with its focus on new and innovative fabrics â€” it has quickly carved out a niche in the high-end undergarment industry.<br />
                And I can testify to this. The underwear feels different from anything Iâ€™ve tried on before. Itâ€™s softer and more luxurious against the skin. Both to actively touch and to passively feel.<br />
                Tani makes the bold claim that their SilkCuts are â€œthe most comfortable boxer briefs you will ever find".</p>
