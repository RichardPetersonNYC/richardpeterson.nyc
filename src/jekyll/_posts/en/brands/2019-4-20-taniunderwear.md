                <p>This is a premium brand and they’re certainly not cheap. But as a guy who’s tested underwear from both ends of the quality spectrum (and everywhere in between) <a class="red ft-400" href="https://instagram.com/taniunderwear?utm_source=ig_profile_share&igshid=1tpof2890ikav/" target="_blank">Tani USA</a> certainly knows what’s up in the comfort department.<br>
                Based in Brooklyn, NY, Tani USA describes itself as the world’s best and most comfortable unisex underwear.<br>
                The brand was founded in 2013 — and with its focus on new and innovative fabrics — it has quickly carved out a niche in the high-end undergarment industry.<br>
                And I can testify to this. The underwear feels different from anything I’ve tried on before. It’s softer and more luxurious against the skin. Both to actively touch and to passively feel.<br>
                Tani makes the bold claim that their SilkCuts are “the most comfortable boxer briefs you will ever find".</p>
